# Pomodoro Minimal

Simple, clean, and configurable tool for your productivity.

## What is Pomodoro?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system designed for increased productivity. You interleave your work sessions with short breaks to keep your attention to maximum, sometimes opting for longer breaks to unwind for a bit so you can focus once the time for work comes again. The most common model suggest 25 minutes for work, 5 minutes for short breaks, and 15 minutes for long ones, which occur after three short breaks. This is just a rule of thumb, and with Pomodoro Minimal you can figure out what works best for you.

## Say no to distractions

Pomodoro Minimal offers minimalistic interface so you can focus on what is important.

Furthermore, if any distracting thought comes to your attention, the program offers you a way to note it down in order not to hinder your attention but also not to lose an interesting idea that your working brain might have produced. With a mere click of a button, a text box appears for you to write a note in and with the next click, it disappears. The notes are stored in the file `distractions.txt` which is located in the same directory as your executable. Feel free to edit the code and insert your own path.
